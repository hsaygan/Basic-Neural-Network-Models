# Basic-Neural-Network-Models
My attempt of creating neural network models for traditional databases. All of the implementation is in [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), along with other libraries like Numpy, SciPy etc.

### Databases:
Databases used to create the models are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) as well as some open source databases.

* [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - Characterizing each testing image into 10 different types of class of images (Random Images of daily entities).
* [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) - Characterizing each testing image into 10 different types of class of images (Handwritten Numbers from 0 to 9).
* [Sentiment-Analysis] - Distiguishing between positive and negative sentences.
* [XOR] - XOR Function Prediction using Neural Network
